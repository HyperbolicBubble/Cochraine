# Risa
C++. TwitchIRC Bot with run-time plugin support written in Lua.

## Live version
We host our own Risa, which is available globally throughout the twitch network. If you want your plugin to be supported, send a link to your source code, to admin@hyperbolicbubble.com.

## Configuration
Making it so number one, could never be easier (we tried to think of a way, but this is about minimal setup as it gets).

Just alter the configuration file, which should look something like below:
```
Configuration file = example
```
Then run it! Couldn't be simpler, could it? (Oh, and make sure you're not sufficating it with closed ports).
