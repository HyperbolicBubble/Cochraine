# Risa
*Enhancing your streaming experience*
## About Risa
Risa is an IRC bot for the Twitch network. It has run-time management for plugins 'pods', that are written in Lua. This means you can load your pods, or unload them whilst running. Therefore minimising downtime, and not affecting your streams!

## Live version
We host our own Risa, which is available globally throughout the twitch network. To get Risa on your channel, go to: http://twitch.tv/hyperbolicbubble and enter in chat: `!invite [channelname]`. Additionally, typing just `!invite` will take the bot to the channel of the account who types it. From there type `!help` for further information.

*If you want your pod to be supported, send a link to your source code, to admin@hyperbolicbubble.com.*

## Configuration
Making it so number one, could never be easier (we tried to think of a way, but this is about minimal setup as it gets).

Just alter the configuration file, which should look something like below:
```
Configuration file = example
```
Then run it! Couldn't be simpler, could it? (Oh, and make sure you're not sufficating it with closed ports).

## Building your own pod
Much like Voyager, we host the facilities for you to build your own pod if you're not happy with the fleet issued ones. Please read the documentation for available methods.
